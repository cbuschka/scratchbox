# writing doc like proramming 20 years ago
write program, no tests, never touch again => wrong, quick change cycles, more features, bugs! changes, regression, maintenance
write doc, no tests, never touch again => wrong, diverges from reality!
countermeasure: recheck/expiry date or/and or doc tests (remove doc at when this test fails)

# price of details
integration tests vs detailed doc
countermeasure: high level/abstractions more stable

# locality
doc in wiki like cronjobs/scripts on servers distributed over the landscape
countermeasure?
